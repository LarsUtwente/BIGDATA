Big data project about dutch tweets and amazon reviews 

Dataset: Dutch tweets and Amazon Reviews (2010-2016) 
Main research question(s): 
Are there sudden spikes in the popularity of specific items or categories on amazon? Do those relate to spikes in specific hashtags or tweets about the item? 
Can we find a correlation between the trends in amazon products and those on twitter? Does the former cause the latter, or the other way around? 
[Does the sentiment for certain amazon products drastically change over the period? Does this extend to twitter?]
